.SH NAME

.P
pam_ihosts - Allow or block login on the basis of mac address, ip address, or ip registrar/region.
.SH SYNOPSIS


.nf

.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
pam\fBi\fPihosts considers a user's remote ip to prevent/allow login by users who have already provided the correct credentials. 
.P
pam_ihosts.so can use the 'stats' files that regional internet registrars provide in order to look up the registrar and country that an IP is registered to, allowing a form of crude geo-location.
.P
\fbBeware\fP. pam_ihosts.so denies login by default for any user that it's specified to handle. Options must be supplied to indicate the mac-address, ip-address, country-code or region of hosts that are allowed to log in.


.SH OPTIONS

.P
PAM options that can be applied to configuration files in /etc/pam.d are as follows.
.TP
.B
\fIuser=[user patterns]\fP
Comma separated list of fnmatch (shell-style) patterns that identify users for whom this rule applies. To match all users either leave this out, leave it blank, or explicitly set it to 'user=\\*'. A '!' character at the start of the pattern allows inversion, so to match all users but root use: 'user=!root'

.TP
.B
\fIsyslog\fP
Record events via syslog messages

.TP
.B
\fIscript=[path]\fP
Run script in the event of a DENY. Arguments passed to the script will be 'User', 'IP', 'Mac Address' and 'Region'. 'Region' will be in the format '<registrar>:<countrycode>' so for example, 'ripencc:GB'.

.TP
.B
\fIallow-ip=[ip]\fP
A comma-separated list of fnmatch patterns that match IP addresses allowed to log in.

.TP
.B
\fIallow-mac=[mac]\fP
A comma-separated list of fnmatch patterns that match MAC addresses allowed to log in.

.TP
.B
\fIallow-dev=[dev]\fP
A comma-separated list of fnmatch patterns that match network device names that the connection is coming to. This is the network adapter on your machine that is \fIreceiving\fP the connection from the remote host.

.TP
.B
\fIallow-region=[region]\fP
A comma-separated list of fnmatch patterns that match region strings looked up in IP registrar files. Region strings are in the format '<registrar>:<countrycode>. This option requires you to supply the paths to the region files with the 'region-files' option. For more details see 'REGIONS' below.

.TP
.B
\fIregion-files=[path]\fP
A comma-separated list of paths to files containing IP registrar assignments. For more details see 'REGIONS' below.

.TP
.B
\fIblacklist=[path]\fP
A comma-separated list of paths to files containing IP addresses, MAC addresses or hostnames that are \fBblacklisted\fP (denied login). One item per line.

.TP
.B
\fIwhitelist=[path]\fP
A comma-separated list of paths to files containing IP addresses, MAC addresses or hostnames that are \fBwhitelisted\fP (allowed login). One item per line.


.SH REGION FILES

.P
Region information is looked up in files provided by the Regional Internet Registries. These files are downloadable at the following addresses:
.P
http://ftp.lacnic.net/pub/stats/lacnic/delegated-lacnic-latest      # Latin America
http://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/stats/delegated-ripencc-latest             # Europe, Russia, Middle East
http://ftp.arin.net/pub/stats/arin/delegated-arin-extended-latest   # North America
http://ftp.afrinic.net/pub/stats/afrinic/delegated-afrinic-latest   # Africa
http://ftp.apnic.net/stats/apnic/delegated-apnic-latest             # Asia Pacific

.SH BLACKLISTS/WHITELISTS

.P
Blacklist/whitelist files contain IP addresses, hostnames, or MAC addresses that are either denied or allowed login. One item per line. All three types of item can be present in the same file. Blacklist files are checked first, and then can be overridden with whitelist files. As pam_ihosts denies login by default, so a whitelist file can be used on its own. To use only a blacklist file, one would have to specify 'allow-ip=*' and then specify a blacklist file, which would have the effect of allowing everything except those things in the blacklist file.

.SH EXAMPLES

.P
Allow root login only from 192.168.0.x

.nf

account    required  pam_ihosts.so user=root syslog allow\-ip=192.168.0.*
.fi
.ad b

.P
For all users allow login only from two mac-addresses

.nf

account    required  pam_ihosts.so user=* allow\-mac=ff:c0:a8:e4:99:31,ff:c0:a8:f9:cc:01
.fi
.ad b

.P
For all users other than root, allow login only from ip-addresses in Great Britain.

.nf

account    required  pam_ihosts.so user=!root region\-files=/etc/ip\-lists/delegated\-afrinic\-latest,/etc/ip\-lists/delegated\-lacnic\-latest,/etc/ip\-lists/delegated\-apnic\-latest,/etc/ip\-lists/delegated\-ripencc\-latest allow\-region=ripencc:GB
.fi
.ad b

.P
For all users, allow login only from Asia Pacific IPs.

.nf

account    required  pam_ihosts.so user=* region\-files=/etc/ip\-lists/delegated\-afrinic\-latest,/etc/ip\-lists/delegated\-lacnic\-latest,/etc/ip\-lists/delegated\-apnic\-latest,/etc/ip\-lists/delegated\-ripencc\-latest allow\-region=apnic:*
.fi
.ad b

.P
Same as above, but perhaps more efficient, only look up regions in the apnic file.

.nf

account    required  pam_ihosts.so user=* region\-files=/etc/ip\-lists/delegated\-apnic\-latest allow\-region=apnic:*
.fi
